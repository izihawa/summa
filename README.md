# Summa

Summa is a full-text, IPFS-friendly, and WASM-compatible search engine that is designed to be lightning fast.

With Summa, your data can be replicated and published through IPFS, allowing for a truly distributed and uncensorable search experience. And, thanks to its compatibility with WASM, Summa can be launched entirely inside your browser, enabling you to search through IPFS-published indexes without ever having to send queries to centralized servers.

If you're ready to experience the power of Summa, be sure to check out our [Quick Start guide](https://izihawa.github.io/summa/guides/quick-start) or our detailed [Architecture description](https://izihawa.github.io/summa/core/architecture).
